# Turing bitcoin non-fungible

An asset can be considered non-fungible when it cannot be replaced by another asset in whole or in part. In simple terms, an asset that can be considered unique due to it's attributes even amongst its own kind, is non-fungible. Gold for instance can be considered fungible, as a kilogram of gold can be replaced by a kilogram of gold.

The idea of turning a fungible asset into non-fungible isn't as original as it would seem. Extending the previous example, a gold artifact with historical significance cannot be replaced by another replica. For more clarity, consider the Nobel Prize, a gold medal symbolozing the reward. In 1943, Niel's Bohr laboratory in Copenhagen was busy dissolving Nobel Prizes of two Nobel laureats, Max von Laue and James Franck to keep them safe from the invading Nazis. The gold was dissolved in a 3:1 mixture of hydrochloric acid and nitric acid and kept on a laboratory shelf in plain sight secured from the clueless Nazi soliders who scavenged the laboratory for traces of gold. The solution was retrived again after the Victory in Europe and the gold extract was sent to the Nobel Foundation, which recast the gold in its appropriate form.

Though for a brief period Von Laue and Franck's awards were reduced to what one would consider an indistinctive blob of gold, the ability to trace back its origins and recasting it into its deserved form brings back the exclusivity.
